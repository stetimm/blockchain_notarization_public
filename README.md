# Blockchain Notarization
This is code for notarization of data via the Ethereum blockchain. It accomplishes two very basic tasks:
1. *Notarization*: It let's you notarize a file, by creating a transaction on the blockchain that stores the hash of the file at the time of notarization.
2. *Verification*: It let's you check that a file you have at hand is identical to the one saved in a given notarization transaction on the blockchain.

The ultimate aim is to integrate this into the experimental software package oTree. This codebase is currently only aiming to be a proof-of-concept.

# Note 
This was originally written for a class I took during my PhD studies at Bonn Graduate School of Economics. I hope to develop this project further in the future.
